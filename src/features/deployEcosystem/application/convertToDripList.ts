// The DripList structure has a two-level design:

//  - Level 2: Contains sub-lists of additional receivers.

// 200 (sub-lists) Ã— 200 (receivers per sub-list) = 40,000 accounts

/**
 * Converts a flat list of nodes into a `DripList` structure.
 * This function organizes nodes according to the following constraints:
 * 1. No level can contain more than `MAX_SPLITS_RECEIVERS` total slots.
 * 2. The first level can contain both direct receivers and sub-list references.
 * 3. Sub-lists can only contain direct receivers.
 *
 * The algorithm works as follows:
 * 1. If all nodes fit within `MAX_SPLITS_RECEIVERS`, creates a single level with no sub-lists
 * 2. Otherwise:
 *
 *    a. Calculates minimum number of sub-lists (x) needed using the formula:
 *       x = ceil((totalIDs - `MAX_SPLITS_RECEIVERS`) / (`MAX_SPLITS_RECEIVERS` - 1))
 *
 *    b. Reserves x slots in the first level for sub-list references
 *
 *    c. Uses remaining (`MAX_SPLITS_RECEIVERS` - x) slots for direct receivers in the first level
 *
 *    d. Distributes remaining nodes across sub-lists
 *
 * The function returns a `DripList` object containing:
 * - `rawReceivers`: array of direct `ProjectReceiver` objects in the first level.
 * - `subListReceivers`: array of arrays, each representing a sub-list of `SubListReceiver` objects.
 *
 * Note that the algorithm is designed to work with max 40,000 nodes.

 *    - Each sub-list reference (based on the aggregate weight of its receivers).

 * The returned structure extends the original `DripList` with:
 * - `projectReceivers`: normalized version of `rawReceivers`
 * - `subLists`: normalized version of `subListReceivers` with an additional
 *   `normalizedWeight` property that indicates the weight allocated to each sub-list.
