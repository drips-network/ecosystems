/**
 * Converts a flat list of nodes into a `EcosystemMainAccount` structure.

 * 1. No level can contain more than `MAX_SPLITS_RECEIVERS` total slots.
 * 2. The first level can contain both direct receivers and sub-list references.
 * 3. Sub-lists can only contain direct receivers.
 *
 * The algorithm works as follows:
 * 1. If all nodes fit within `MAX_SPLITS_RECEIVERS`, creates a single level with no sub-lists.
 * 2. Otherwise:
 *
 *    a. Calculates minimum number of sub-lists (x) needed using the formula:
 *       x = ceil((totalIDs - `MAX_SPLITS_RECEIVERS`) / (`MAX_SPLITS_RECEIVERS` - 1))
 *
 *    b. Reserves x slots in the first level for sub-list references.
 *
 *    c. Uses remaining (`MAX_SPLITS_RECEIVERS` - x) slots for direct receivers in the first level.
 *
 *    d. Distributes remaining nodes across sub-lists.
 *
 * The function returns a `NormalizedEcosystemMainAccount` object.
